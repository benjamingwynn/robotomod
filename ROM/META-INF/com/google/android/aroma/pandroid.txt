Thanks for selecting ParanoidAndroid as your core for RobotoMOD :)

If you do not know what ParanoidAndroid is then here is a quick run by:

ParanoidAndroid is a ROM that lets YOU define in which UI your apps display â€“ be it tablet mode, or normal phone mode. There's also a bunch of extra goodies in settings for customisation like transparent status bar etc.

Because you are selecting this core as your base, it means you will suffer the following bugs in RobotoMOD that are in ParanoidAndroid.

- The ROM is not as stable as AOKP or CM9
- HQ videos don't work
- Sometimes a pop up will appear saying a new SIM card has been inserted and wants you to restart the phone. Just press back when this message appears
- Tablet mode doesn't work
