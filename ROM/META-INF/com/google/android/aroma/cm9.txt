Thank you for selecting CM9 as your core for RobotoMOD.

Your choice as CM9 for your core means that RobotoMOD will have the same bugs as those in modpunk's CM9 ROM.
For clarification, those bugs are:

- Camera doesn't fully work
- HQ videos don't work
- Fast toggling Bluetooth on/off cause the phone to reboot
- Voice search doesn't work, can be fixed by removing with Titanium Backup and reinstalling from the Play Store
- Sometimes a pop up will appear saying a new SIM card has been inserted and wants you to restart the phone. Just press back when this message appears
