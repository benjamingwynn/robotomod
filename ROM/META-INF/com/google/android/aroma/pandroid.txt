PLEASE FINISH ME. BENJAMIN IS TOO LAZY :P

Thanks for selecting ParanoidAndroid as your core for RobotoMOD :)

If you do not know what ParanoidAndroid is then here is a quick run by:

<put shit here>

Because you are selecting this core as your base, it means you will suffer the following bugs in RobotoMOD that are in ParanoidAndroid.

- WiFi is fucked
- Camera doesn't fully work
- HQ videos don't work
- Fast toggling Bluetooth on/off cause the phone to reboot
- Voice search doesn't work, can be fixed by removing with Titanium Backup and reinstalling from the Play Store
- Sometimes a pop up will appear saying a new SIM card has been inserted and wants you to restart the phone. Just press back when this message appears
