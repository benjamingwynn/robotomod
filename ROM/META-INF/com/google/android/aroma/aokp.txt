Thank you for selecting AOKP as your core for Roboto.

AOKP has more features over CM9 including:

- Nav Bar Transparency
- Transparent status bar
- Weather in notication bar
- Center clock in status bar
- Improved toggles
- More at www.aokp.co

AOKP is a stable and working ROM however, the following DOES NOT WORK on AOKP:

- Camera
- Video streaming

There can also be strange bugs on times such as:

- Rarely, some users will be prompted with a "sim card changed" error and are forced to reboot
- YouTube can force close
